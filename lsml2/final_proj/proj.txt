DESCRIPTION

In this project you are asked to create an ML-service to solve any kind of task.
You should define the task you are going to solve. 
Task definition should contain:
	* input and output description;
	* approach chosen to solve (model description);
	* dataset for model training;
	* runtime architecture for the resulting service.

You can publish your code on private GitHub repo.
