Before you begin open RelaAX calculator https://dbis-uibk.github.io/relax/ and load the "hotel" database into it.

Find guests (id, name, email) who each time stayed the same number of nights or longer, than previously.


Variant A:

π gid, gName, email (
	(
		π A.gid (
			σ A.start > B.start 
				and A.gid = B.gid 
				and A.nights >= B.nights (
					ρ A (
						π gid, start, nights (Stay)
					) ⨯ ρ B (
						π gid, start, nights (Stay)
					)
				)
		) - π A.gid (
			σ A.start > B.start 
				and A.gid = B.gid
				and A.nights < B.nights (
					ρ A (
						π gid, start, nights (Stay)
					) ⨯ ρ B (
						π gid, start, nights (Stay)
					)
				)
		)
	) ⨝ Guest
)


Variant B (not so good and clear):

π result.gid, gName, email (
	ρ result (
		(
			π gid Guest -
			π s_1.gid
				σ s_1.gid = s_2.gid and
					s_1.start > s_2.start and
					s_1.nights < s_2.nights (
						ρ s_1 Stay ⨯ ρ s_2 Stay
					)
		) -
		π gid
			ρ count_filter (
				π gid, count_sid
					σ count_sid = 1
						γ gid; COUNT(sid) → count_sid Stay
			)
	) ⨝ result.gid = Guest.gid Guest
)
